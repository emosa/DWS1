It is held on the last Wednesday of August, during the week of festivities of Bunol.</p>	        <h2>History</h2>	        <p>In 1945, during a parade of <em>gigantes y cabezudos</em>, young men who wanted to be in the event staged a brawl in town's main square, the Plaza del Pueblo. There was a vegetable stand nearby, so they picked up tomatoes and used them as weapons. The police had to intervene to break up the fight and forced those responsible to pay the damages incurred. This is the most popular of many theories about how the Tomatina started.</p>   			<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomatina</p>		        </div>	</body></html>
